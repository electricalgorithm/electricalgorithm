### Projects and Categories
##### Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision
- [**Classic Genetic Algorithm for PID Tunning**](https://github.com/electricalgorithm/ClassicGeneticAlgorithm4PID): This is a learning algorithm to find best PID controller gains with genetic algorithm. It has an API and GUI interfaces to implement for your own project.
- [**Shallow CNN for COVID19 with CLAHE Preprocessing**](https://github.com/electricalgorithm/NCLAHE-ShallowCNN-COVID19): A Shallow CNN model which classifies COVID-19 X chest x-rays. The original point is to have adaptive histogram equalization as a preprocessing step. It uses Tensorflow.
- [**Restaurant Review Binary Clasifer**](https://github.com/electricalgorithm/RestaurantReviewClassifier): A natural language processing application which is written from scratch (no ML library used). I've used logistic regression to create the model.
- [**Vectofil+**](https://github.com/electricalgorithm/vectofil): A GUI tool to reduce vector-based filters to your image. Vector-based filters are commonly used on image enhancement to reduce noises. I've implemented BVDF, VMF, and their combination filter. This combination filter has a setting to change percentage of each filter in operation.
- [**Decision Tree with Information Gain Splitting**](https://github.com/electricalgorithm/DecisionTree-InformationGain): A decision tree library that I've written from scratch. It uses informative gain as splitting method.
- [**Quality Conrol on Mirror Production**](https://github.com/electricalgorithm/QualityConrolMirrorProduction): It is an proof-of-concept tool to perform quality controls on mirror production. It works on prepared environment with Raspberry Pi as the controller. I created it while my internship on YongaTek.
- [**Edge Detection of Conveyor Bands**](https://github.com/electricalgorithm/ConveyorBandEdgeDetection): A tool to predict edges of a conveyor band. It only uses image processing techniques. I created it while my internship on YongaTek.

##### Quantum Computing
- [**Quantum Fourier Transform**](https://github.com/electricalgorithm/QuantumFourierTransform): This algorithm lets you to apply DFT to a state with quantum circuits. It has decreased the complexity to O(NlogN) from classical O(N^2) approach.
- [**Bernstein Vazirani Algorithm**](https://github.com/electricalgorithm/BernsteinVaziraniAlgorithm): Find a secret number with O(1) complexity using Quantum Computing instead of classical O(n) approach.
- [**Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm**](https://github.com/electricalgorithm/DeutschJozsaAlgorithm): This algorithm lets you to find a the type of a binary function in O(1) complexity instead of classical O(n/2) approach.
- [**Quantum Teleportation**](https://github.com/electricalgorithm/QuantumTeleportation): This script is a simple implementation on Quantum Teleportation theorem.

##### Embedded Applications

This project is not completed since I've not seperated the API, however, it can be thought as a boilerplate. Written using RP2040 C SDK.
- [**4 Digit 7 Segment Display Driver in VHDL**](https://www.electricalgorithm.xyz/4-digit-7-segment-display-vhdl/): It is a chip that drives seven segment displays with inputs as BCD numbers. I've used moduler approach to create the mechanism which let's you easily change the project for your needs.
- [**Fixed Sequence Traffic Light Controller in VHDL**](https://www.electricalgorithm.xyz/fixed-sequence-traffic-light-controller/): It is a controller chip designed with state machine principles to control fixed-sequence traffic lights.
- [**Sparkfun Qwiic Keypad Library for MicroPython**](https://github.com/electricalgorithm/micropython-qwiic-keypad): MicroPython library for using Sparkfun's Qwiic Keypad with 12-buttons.
- [**A Raspberry Pi Car with Camera**](https://github.com/electricalgorithm/invdef_server): This project has been created for controlling a car with Raspberry Pi which has two-sided encrypted communication with remote controller and a camera sender with high FPS. This project was funded by TUBITAK.
- [**Introduction to VHDL with Projects**](https://github.com/electricalgorithm/introduction-to-VHDL-projects): The project I've implented on VHDL while learning FPGAs.
- [**mbed Application Development**](https://github.com/electricalgorithm/marun-cse2037): This repository includes the files and software examples to train yourself for ARM mbed usage.
